# LaligaBuzz
This website will be developed to become one of best football websites of our country in upcoming years. This is just a prototype which is in development. We hope that we will get assistance &amp; positive views from our viewers.

Welcome to LaligaBuzz 

1.First we need to open Xampp and start mySql.

2.Then we have to copy 'sd' folder  to 'C:\xampp\htdocs\' directory and
	and copy our database 'laliga_db.sql'

3.Now from any browser we have to go 'localhost/sd/index.php' then our start page appears.

4.To maintain Project file size we have deleted our videos that were appeared previously in homepage ( as they were more than 1GB).

5. From dropdown menu we can choose team names and Team stats ( as shortage of time we just included two teams Barcelona and Real Madrid) .

6.We can also View player list ( Only Barcelona and Real Madrid players were included ) . 

7.From player List we can see player details, player stats ( Lionel Messi from Barcelona , and Cristiano Ronaldo from Real Madrid )

8. To go to admin panel which was hidden from viewers we used "http://localhost/sd/wp-admin.php"

9. We can any username and password. then we will have our Insert Schedule form. In future we will add more admin panel.

with these steps we can run our project.
